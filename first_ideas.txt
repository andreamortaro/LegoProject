1st STEP: 
Starting from a 3d model in .stl format we want to perform a voxelization.

STL FORMAT:
An .stl file describe only the geometry of a 3d surface, without colors or textures attributes. The surface is discretized by triangles. In the .stl file is stored the information where each object is a triangle with 3 vertices and the facet normal.

Site for .stl files:

Opened "Wooden chair.stl" with an online stl-viewer and in blender.

We have found a stl reader for Matlab:

Equivalently we viewed the .stl file also in python. Harder to manage than Matlab, points not in tabular form: your_mash.points in python.
